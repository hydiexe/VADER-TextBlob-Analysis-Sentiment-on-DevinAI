Inference: Devin must be fixing bugs in files it has itself created, but that&#39;s not clearly indicated.<br><br>• There is no need to do any coding in the first place, because the README in the repository has all the instructions needed to achieve the task ready to go and they still work fine with only a one-line tweak, even though the repository is old. This is why the customer asked for instructions for how to run it on EC2 rather than for some coding. Devin didn&#39;t seem to read the README or understand that it only had to execute a couple of pre-existing Python scripts. The output in the video makes it look like the task was complex and sophisticated, with a long plan and many check boxes showing work completed, but the work was in fact pointless and redundant.<br><br>• Devin&#39;s code changes are bad, e.g. writing its own low level file read loop instead of using the standard library properly.<br><br>• Although the video makes it look like Devin did the task quickly, and the video creator was able to do the requested task in ~30 minutes, the timestamps in the chat show the task stretching over many hours and even into the next day.<br><br>• Devin does nonsensical shell commands like `head -n 5 foo | tail -n 5`',\n",

The developer would need to try to reverse engineer the entire process and find out first what Devin was trying to do, what the mistake was, how it can be solved, and then try to integrate that into Devin&#39;s solution. This is the issue not only with Devin but also with AI in general, including ChatGPT. There is a running joke about &quot;coding&quot; in 2 minutes with AI and debugging for hours, and that it is true. These tools are useful, at the moment, only for simple pieces of code, like creating a boilerplate for a React component, a basic database, generating mock data, etc., but no real programmer would use them to build something that requires deep critical thinking and metacognition. Am I saying that these tools will not get better? No. But let&#39;s consider that evolution happens in both ways (humans and robots). Two years ago, junior developers would proudly build a simple calculator or a one-page HTML and JavaScript page and make it the focus of their portfolio. Today, with the current tools, a junior developer can easily apply knowledge of APIs, databases, frameworks, etc., to build a CRUD application in a matter of weeks/days. As these machines get smarter, human beings are also getting more competent at building more complex projects and liberating their time to think and truly innovate, building products that are useful and impactful. We have a very exciting future ahead of us.',\n",
