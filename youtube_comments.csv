2024-05-26T13:38:39Z,certainly that devin AI would be integrated into an IDE like visual studio if its that devin AI could create a computer program entirely according to your request from the IDE good after the current chatgpt can help you create your computer program but with steps to follow knowing that chatgpt also creates the codes 😊👍👍👍😊😊👍👍😊👍
2024-05-19T14:38:14Z,Dear Scott. You are a scammer. And i hope you scam all those VCs pretty well and quick. 😁
2024-05-19T08:34:32Z,It’s life a for being software engineer being replaced by AI just imagine.
2024-05-18T15:05:44Z,"What is the 255^2 mi- 

Scott: 5000.

5000 is the correct answer!"
2024-05-18T08:31:52Z,Do you ages platform that I can try to design a software application for my business?
2024-05-17T15:38:42Z,You lied to us 🖕😡
2024-05-17T09:38:31Z,"Its been two months, release it already, i wanna see how itll work with unreal engine."
2024-05-16T23:37:49Z,"welp there goes at least 100,00 jobs"
2024-05-15T11:17:23Z,You stop right there and don’t move! Karen.
2024-05-15T03:00:48Z,The key point is how to fix bugs :P
2024-05-14T18:46:15Z,🤣 It's a scam.
2024-05-11T22:27:04Z,why am i thinking scott is devin
2024-05-10T01:05:44Z,"Some skills that would probably never be possible or at least would probably be the last skill set for AI to replace:

1. AI/ML (requires complex and mathematical problem-solving)
2. Cybersecurity (dealing with sensitive data)
3. Computer networking
4. OS programming
5. Mechanical engineering (till the arrival of robots, which are very expensive to build)
6. Electrical engineering (dealing with electrical systems, which even robots may struggle with)
7. Chemical engineering (dealing with potentially harmful chemicals)
8. Surgery (even if an AI surgeon comes, it may lack the human precision and empathy with the patient and may be dangerous for the patient's life)"
2024-05-05T05:49:46Z,Is has any specific website or not ??
2024-05-04T23:01:34Z,Yo guys you re not loosing your jobs to ai. Who re the engineers to run the prompt. It's only assistant to developers . And meanwhile no layman can pickup Devin and understand whole development process to build a project for his business . Welcome to the future tho .
2024-05-03T12:29:52Z,"I am trying to get access from past one and a half month still cognition team doesn't replied. Filled the form, mailed them too but 0 response. Is this the way you are going to take this AI enabled software engineer ahead whom people can't use."
2024-05-02T14:57:38Z,I created first  Ai underware engineering 😂
2024-05-02T12:08:44Z,Millions of software engineers will curse this devin
2024-05-02T08:18:32Z,"New fear unlock! 
What if someone build it in real😢"
2024-04-29T12:25:13Z,Scott Wu is exceptionally gifted at being an idiot.
2024-04-28T01:28:15Z,Don't make people fool. Tell us the truth. You're probably manipulating this fool AI's capabilities. What is the truth?!
2024-04-27T00:07:05Z,Is this the CEO the internet was jerking off because he won some competitive programming competitions? Hilarious.
2024-04-26T14:27:29Z,How can I use devin? 🤔
2024-04-26T12:11:19Z,Why the hell does it need to put print statement? Doesnt it know all run time data structure values.?
2024-04-26T11:37:44Z,Thats what the world needed. Thx for helping to make thousands of people unemployed. There are a lot of useful tasks for integrating ai that people could benefit from. Thats definately not one of those. Good example of people just trying to make money at all costs.
2024-04-26T08:18:14Z,@scott - how can I try this out please?
2024-04-25T09:14:26Z,"Hi, Im very interested."
2024-04-25T09:10:08Z,"I actually asked chatgpt for assistance for my own ideas for on🌍🦸 but neededthis type of ai advancement appreciate it but it it's expensive im dead, sometimes you have the 💡 but funds are the issue. Thank you for the update. Appreciate it.

2024-04-22T13:57:54Z,"Devin exposed, lied , fake hipe"
2024-04-22T05:33:15Z,unironically im a computer engineer and my job is being taken by an AI
2024-04-21T15:43:22Z,Finally devin is revealed and its a lie . Devin rip(2024-24)
2024-04-21T11:35:23Z,Man this made me lose confidence and made me not want to study only be a fake wow . Fake devin may your damn company fail.
2024-04-21T03:59:45Z,This failed horribly
2024-04-20T14:29:13Z,"Lol , thats what u expect from a competative programmer"
2024-04-20T10:07:50Z,they lied to us
2024-04-20T09:40:39Z,Bro i am not afraid of this circus joker named devin. They think that they have built a devil for us. But thats not true. Recent news have came that devin was programmed to do a specific problem. And also we dont know anything that is going on in this video. Maybe it was programmed to do a specific task. News have came that a task that takes aost a day for devin is done in 3 to 6 hours by a human. So focus on becoming a great skilled software engii and dont let this skinny japanesse guy named scott scare you. I think this devin and the creators just wanted some fundings. These guys are fake.
2024-04-20T07:46:07Z,Go on❤
2024-04-20T07:12:54Z,Fake than my imaginary gf😂

2024-04-19T11:18:04Z,Lmao typical competitive programmers. Just overhyping themselves over creating nothing of actual value.

https://www.theseason.org/nt.htm    At that page is a index. 
The right side of the page has its own columns of Hyperlinks leading to txt studies all indexed with pages for their chapters.
Would be interesting if it ( Devin ) could copy all of those studies and organize it I guess this would be a scraping procedure.
 However after doing that, compose a summary for each book or chapter of these studies. Then I guess it would be cool if it could create a interesting presentation of its own for these studies and build a web page or site around its summaries. What if it could do this with a YouTube study series from the video and audio and compose it into text format?  I have a curious request for subjects that interests me."
2024-04-18T03:58:35Z,"dont worry , the video made by AI, the voice made by AI. oh ya and the whole comment generated by AI. me and you are not real we are all AI. so give me your wallets!"

2024-04-17T17:12:10Z,This guy have the most punchable face ever.  That evil smirk while pretending to take away our jobs. Now it's been discovered that they fake their demonstration to make this look WAY better than it is. smh
2024-04-17T15:22:52Z,By the time people can use this the open source variants will be so much better that Devin will be a little ant running in a circle.
2024-04-17T14:37:17Z,"Hey Mr. Scott, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, make our jobs fell through."
2024-04-17T14:10:49Z,"So a fake demo of the plane flying to show how the company can make a plane fly?

What could go wrong? :)))))))))))

Or better: How much money was thrown into this before confirming this does actually work?"
2024-04-17T13:44:44Z,Just some complex ‘if else’ on the backend 😂

2024-04-17T04:08:43Z,Looked into this as a software engineer myself and can say its best suited to help grade school kids with their coding assignments and thats all.
2024-04-16T22:52:42Z,"Don't worry guys, As long as they can't center div we are in business."

2024-04-15T20:37:29Z,"For those who are scared of Devin.  You need to think on how to work with AI as tool and not a competitor.  Someone still needs to prompt, assist and use the software being built.   You won't be replaced by AI.  You should be concerned about the developer who really know how to leverage AI to be more productive."
2024-04-15T20:26:23Z,@cognition we know you company is totally fake and marketing gimmick 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2024-04-15T16:18:25Z,So do we still need software engineering in high demand job if we have ai
2024-04-15T15:23:30Z,Lol its fake and  failed to perform what it promised relax now programmers and take a shower😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 no literally take a show i can smell the comment section
2024-04-15T14:53:02Z,can someone tell me if I should go with becoming a Doctor or SWE I have both options but only the next 2 months to decide.
2024-04-15T12:29:57Z,I started my career through developing 😢

2024-04-15T07:54:31Z,You Guys are a bunch of fake scoundrels👎
2024-04-15T06:56:00Z,just came here to say  I thought he was devin from the pictures I see online  😂
2024-04-15T00:20:06Z,I mean your company is full of fake demos.
2024-04-14T23:55:23Z,Just came to see the comments after the truth revealed

2024-04-14T06:50:19Z,wait for another AI to replace Devin😁
2024-04-14T05:01:31Z,I heard this demo is actually fake
2024-04-13T22:17:52Z,"Devin is sold as being able to solve arbitrary Upwork tasks. In the video demo the problem it was asked to solve doesn't match the stated requirements of the customer (who asked for setup instructions, not code).

• Devin is shown fixing errors in the source of a GitHub repo, but the files it's shown editing don't actually exist in that repo and some of the errors its fixing are nonsensical, of the type that'd never be made by a human. Inference: Devin must be fixing bugs in files it has itself created, but that's not clearly indicated.

• There is no need to do any coding in the first place, because the README in the repository has all the instructions needed to achieve the task ready to go and they still work fine with only a one-line tweak, even though the repository is old. This is why the customer asked for instructions for how to run it on EC2 rather than for some coding. Devin didn't seem to read the README or understand that it only had to execute a couple of pre-existing Python scripts. The output in the video makes it look like the task was complex and sophisticated, with a long plan and many check boxes showing work completed, but the work was in fact pointless and redundant.

• Devin's code changes are bad, e.g. writing its own low level file read loop instead of using the standard library properly.

• Although the video makes it look like Devin did the task quickly, and the video creator was able to do the requested task in ~30 minutes, the timestamps in the chat show the task stretching over many hours and even into the next day.

• Devin does nonsensical shell commands like `head -n 5 foo | tail -n 5`"
2024-04-13T21:45:37Z,Devin in action is just bunch of bs
2024-04-13T20:19:38Z,"Software development and the way it translates to machine code has always been ""layered"" and always will be; this is a new level in programming.  Programming languages, and what we call libraries and frameworks, were already a sign that the layer at which we code today is already too low for the complexity of the requirements we are facing.   I was coding assembler in the 80s.  Gosh, have I seen so many layers building up since?   I would be called an old nagger by nowadays developers if I complained that my machine code skills couldn't make my bread and butter anymore.   The only scary part I would say is the speed at which this new 'paradigm' unfolds.  Our biological brains surely won't get faster used to the idea of re-skilling ourselves into efficient manipulators to become successful at what we today call programming.  I can't judge on the Devin in the details as it is not released yet, instead I can say I see a great developers companion in this agent."
2024-04-13T03:27:09Z,"So instead of paying a software engineer 100k yearly for my company, I can now pay $19.99 for a monthly AI  subscription ? 😂"
2024-04-13T02:06:31Z,"I'm ready to make a monthly donation for Devin, it's the best thing that happened this year"
2024-04-12T17:36:39Z,why not make Devin himself refine himself to make it public tomorrow
2024-04-12T02:22:24Z,So glad I never wasted my time learning to code 😂
2024-04-10T23:00:38Z,"here we go again with another over hyped technology that will probably fail to deliver on their true promise. Guys relax, software engineering is not building scripts it is building complex systems that will take decades for AI to be able to implement and understand(if ever), and then they will still need software engineers to ask the right questions and debug and fix shit. You can view AI as just another fancy programming language."
2024-04-10T13:50:31Z,"So is Devin the actual start of Skynet and AI creating its own software? Devin learning to hack other software? Devin learning to write overrides on existing machines? Devin taking over robotics factories? Devin making a self sustaining army? ""etc etc""?"
2024-04-09T07:13:06Z,I tried this and it's absolutely useless. Even a ten year old could do better than this trash.
2024-04-09T02:41:13Z,"Feels ""too good to be true"" case. Pretty sure this doesn't perform as shown."

2024-04-08T20:27:37Z,by the way i stand with Devin i really want to try it to build something  i sent a request i hope you guys will let me put my hands on devin
2024-04-08T20:25:46Z,LOL just imagin when Mr Devin read all of your comments he will cry or maybe laugh ? 😂😂😂😂
2024-04-08T17:29:30Z,"did he ever consider, that he will make millions of people jobless."
2024-04-08T16:31:24Z,little chinese man with a big smile introduces you the reason losing your dev job in the future: DevIL
2024-04-08T05:32:26Z,he will pay when devin will make him resign from his company

BTW one advice to coders adapt with AI or perish.

2024-04-03T00:45:43Z,whats the point of hiring new software developers if you already built an ai to do that. just ask it to program itself. i hate this and i hate everyone who contributed to it.
2024-04-02T01:31:38Z,Devin is not powerful as much as to replace human engineer.
2024-04-01T19:17:59Z,"Thanks Devin for unsaturating the market and driving idiots to get out of CS! 

Devin is literally ChatGPT with some visuals lmfao"

RIP 2 you all"
2024-04-01T05:52:42Z,"Before anyone gets anxious about Devin understand this; IT'S NOT PERFECT !!! It's not going to replace the job of the the software engineer. Yet, it may change the skill sets required in that occupation. Employees will want to be more focused on more specialized and deeper programming skills. In addition developing more soft skills will be required."
2024-04-01T03:53:11Z,"Wow, extraordinary! The kinds of jobs we'll do in future will be quite different to what we do now by the looks of things. Maybe a human who keeps up with some small percent of AI's is as good as we can manage! What a world! The Buddha would suggest the job for us is the same, ""do no harm, do good, train your own mind"", perhaps we just get on with that for this lifetime!"
2024-04-01T02:33:52Z,"Devin, Please  develop a 2024 tax return software ?"
2024-03-31T22:21:13Z,He is smiling like Devin has held him captive while destroying his profession. Blink twice if you're okay.
2024-03-31T20:30:51Z,"Why?.... everything was going well being programmer, but now it comes harder, and all we have to do is make learning double fast to NOT being replaced by a computer or at least something like that. Good luck people on doing that"
2024-03-31T17:33:26Z,"In the end, it was the nerds that conquered the world"
2024-03-31T16:01:22Z,"I dont think Devin is real. Its nearly impossible to build such a perfect AI that has its own command line, browser, code editor which is built by a team of only 10 engineers under 5 months period. It takes a lot of time to just  build a full functional browser or a code editor or a command line for a well established company that has a top tier software engineers.

This seem like a fiction to me."
2024-03-31T08:57:16Z,Who is here after watching the reels 😢😢😢
2024-03-31T06:10:22Z,I want to try and thanks
2024-03-31T05:02:21Z,"Hi, can I get Devin to write an iOS app into Android?
Thanks,
Matt"
2024-03-31T01:59:31Z,"Hey Scott - not kidding but can I really ask you guys (ie Devin) to code something that can be intriguing? (I am from academia, not in CS but in medicine)."
2024-03-30T22:04:08Z,"So this guy come out with an IA who could replace the entire sector of programing code completly, so then he could live without programing the rest of his life collecting the money of his invention??... wow, what a mate you have on Scott, rihgt? hahaha"
2024-03-30T09:22:04Z,You know we shouldn't have an a.i create software-this is how skynet is made
2024-03-30T00:43:14Z,I'd love to try it out.
2024-03-30T00:08:08Z,"Men I am in my 4 semester of college for OH YOU GUESS IT, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING YEAH, f*ck you Devin me and my family had to sold our car just for me to enter college and now I just know that I will have to work in a McDonald's all of my life thanks to you Delvin, I really wanted to explore the world because of yeah I will work as a software engineer, but now what I can't afford anything because now my future job is a useless piece of paper, but yeah all it is to make rich people even richeer, and crush all of young people hopes and dreams it is what it is, isn't cognition company but yeah you will not care about this because you're just a bunch of rich bastards that can't stand than when there's no workers there is no economy, so yeah I will wait for you to just f*ck up and realize what you've done"
2024-03-29T18:33:39Z,lol you know by the time you guys actually launch they’ll be a thousand alternatives right?
2024-03-29T17:24:34Z,Hey I’d like to try out devin
2024-03-29T17:10:50Z,"For every freshers Or developers don't panic it's just the push don't be scared of the benchmarks it's not always the correct , benchmarks can also be obtained by best case scenario  

In 2014 people introduced  the first AI CEO look at the scenarios now are the CEO'S are AI?   NO! right  like that we will overcome this hype to

At the end the day don't forget that it's just the Algorithmic model!! 
So, focus on your work"
2024-03-29T16:08:47Z,Don't worry bro Calculator cannot replace mathematician💪💪
2024-03-29T08:02:43Z,"Thanks for this Dr. Oppenheimer .. this is just what the world needed.. not cancer cure, or relief from global warming !! Thanks a lot...😡"
2024-03-29T02:11:47Z,"I wouldn't be so ""excited"". Why is it that smart people create really dangerous stuff that in the end always ends up in the wrong hands? As AI undoubtedly will. What a ""great"" idea: screw humanity, replace it with computers, dumb down cognition, rely on tech and eventually become obsolete... NO THANK YOU!"
2024-03-28T15:51:51Z,It's should be used on Defence sector not commercial sector and companies.
2024-03-28T13:15:18Z,What the fuck is that this company literally destroy the   career of software engineers🤧😫🤦🏻‍♂️
2024-03-28T12:17:53Z,how can I get access? let me know the process
2024-03-28T12:07:12Z,🤬🤬🤬 #BoycottDevin
2024-03-28T11:14:30Z,"Well guys, its time to become farmers"
2024-03-28T08:21:46Z,"wanna see a video about created with ai

2024-03-27T23:36:27Z,so no one's gonna talk about his glasses?
2024-03-27T15:54:28Z,"At 3 o'clock in the morning when the entire Business Network Infrastructure goes down for a week because some Russian hacker permanently takes down Amazon Web Services, it won't be Devin that gets it back up. There are many books written on the dumbing down of society with the reliance on renting external corporations servers in order to function.  So what happens when those servers are no longer available?

You also have to look at rental cost of this service over 10 years. Microsoft for example companies used to pay $500,000 CND a year for a 8 years for perpetual licenses, now they pay $48,000,000 CND a YEAR for Microsoft 365 for the same amount of computers.  Add on Co-pilot at $30 per month per user and the price jumps to $57,000,000.

That is a 10 year Annual cost with AI of $570,000,000 or over 1/2 a BILLION Dollars."
2024-03-27T14:42:10Z,Eat shit cognition ai
2024-03-27T14:05:02Z,can a non program like me use it and make a website? lets see
2024-03-27T13:04:40Z,"I already have a new business model:
1) ask Devin to write his source code
2) rename it jessica
3) become millionaire"
2024-03-27T12:37:21Z,Did the developers realized that they are writing an algorithm which is going to replace all of them who worked on that program. 😄
2024-03-27T10:24:51Z,"No matter how advanced an era is, blaming the situation can never change what has happened, the most important thing we can do is adapt to it"
2024-03-27T06:42:31Z,cool
2024-03-27T03:49:38Z,"To all of the software engineers that are saying they will lose their job, I may have a solution, become one of the developers to help this AI grow, so you help it develop and maybe it might not take this job."
2024-03-27T01:48:05Z,"Well Well Well, seems impossible to fight with Devin lets find out where Scott gets off."
2024-03-27T00:37:01Z,most likely will be used to autogenerate algorithms for automated killing machines. just a matter of time.
2024-03-27T00:00:16Z,"Exactly how Devin’s code isn’t original, none of these comments are"
2024-03-26T23:06:31Z,Is your videos edited by AI?
2024-03-26T20:40:10Z,when is it coming out?
2024-03-26T19:25:07Z,"excited
 to try"
2024-03-26T17:39:28Z,I can't wait for programmers to finally feel like artists :D
2024-03-26T16:17:41Z,Alhmdulllah i didn't study IT and went for social studies 😂😂😂😂😂
2024-03-26T14:56:29Z,All likes are from company's
2024-03-26T08:00:52Z,"AI taking jobs and making lots of people unemployed and affecting lots of families and 
these senseless peoples are happy saying and announcing here comes another version of AI taking your jobs 😟. Not understanding why these peoples are upto destroying human societies"

2024-03-26T05:47:36Z,Why is it fetching errors???
2024-03-26T04:38:20Z,Everyone thinks AI will take 90% jobs but who will buy stuff if there are no jobs😂😂😂. AI will create more jobs in my opinion.
2024-03-26T03:12:41Z,alright lets switch to medical field before Medin come out
2024-03-26T01:38:12Z,You think you replace human's brain with this 😂 . If we want hack it we can do essely 😂 with RND 😂😂
2024-03-26T01:32:50Z,"""No One Can Beat Humans""."
2024-03-26T00:15:03Z,Why would you do this to us
2024-03-25T23:30:56Z,It’s been 3 months since I have been looking for a software developer as a co founder in my project but they all are not willing to put the work. With this advancement i hope we have proper version to use by the end of this year so i would be able to create my own project after getting understanding of it. Thank you for resolving such a big problem for entrepreneurs like me.
2024-03-25T20:16:38Z,Nvidia CEO told us  now see. 😢
2024-03-25T20:10:40Z,This guy look like dont have a life 😂.
2024-03-25T19:05:49Z,fuck devin for making software engineers loose their jobs
2024-03-25T18:00:16Z,If software engineers were walking before now they will be riding on devin. Devin is not going to eliminate them but is going to boost thier productivity.
2024-03-25T17:03:37Z,Cant wait to wake up in a pod and knowing that i am 'The One'
2024-03-25T16:25:27Z,"Should have named it ""Skynet"" instead"
2024-03-25T14:09:51Z,"You mean that all my hardwork to score in JEE and take the CSE is worthless ( meanwhile my fucking 18 Lakh INR) fees is worthless and my life, FUCK !"
2024-03-25T13:12:23Z,"What a cool AI Bro.. Can I know from where did you learned all about AI?
Actually I was studying in a collage in CSE department to become a software engineer but i guess now I've to learn AI and make something to compete you and your Devin and create something which creates job not takes job -_-"
2024-03-25T12:29:01Z,This is what I wanted to develop still robust but I got no money and team . I'm lone warrior 😢
2024-03-25T12:12:51Z,"People who aren't software engineers and are currently learning about technology might feel anxious or insecure about the potential impact of AI tools like ""Devin.""🤣🤣 However, from a developer's perspective, these tools are simply additional aids that can assist in the development process. Even looking ahead a decade or more, companies will continue to rely on human developers. It's highly unlikely that a CEO would personally use a tool like ""Devin"" and suddenly claim they can handle all development tasks. The reality is that there's a significant number of real-world problems requiring immediate solutions, and this is where skilled engineers play an indispensable role.

AI POV: Indeed, while AI can automate certain tasks and make certain processes more efficient, there are still many aspects of software development that require human expertise, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. CEOs and decision-makers in companies understand the value of skilled developers and the critical role they play in building and maintaining technology systems.

It's unlikely to completely eliminate the need for skilled professionals in the foreseeable future."
2024-03-25T11:55:45Z,"i think this is amazing
i want AI to code for me
because i have million different ideas
fuck developers
they always do a sloppy job and overcharge
they deserve to go out of work"
2024-03-25T11:50:11Z,because of you world will celeberate  world beggar day soon!
2024-03-25T09:43:50Z,I hope nobody asks Devin to write Skynet from Terminator.
2024-03-25T08:36:10Z,"so, why cognition labs open position software engineer ? i saw on cognition labs website. just using devin for self-build."
2024-03-25T07:22:56Z,I wanna try it
2024-03-25T05:33:52Z,"please in all that is holy, don't let this AI bullshit take our jobs and our futures."
2024-03-25T05:32:58Z,Whatss to try it
2024-03-25T03:53:53Z,"Prometheus stole the fire from the gods and gave it to men, for this he was tortured for eternity.

To all Prometheus(es?), it was an honour to code with you all, this journey was a kick, from looking over stack overflow for simple solutions to being ecstatic when we figure out the solution to a complex one, this path was good while it lasted. Wish you all, a good journey."
2024-03-25T03:37:51Z,I would like access to Devin
2024-03-25T03:32:36Z,"you can see , bro is really fckin happy"
2024-03-25T00:57:53Z,Imagine writing devin and then loosing your job cause devin can write itself
2024-03-24T23:55:52Z,"If you think AI will replace devs, that's mean you have a chicken brain. or an amateur who never been working in a big complex project"
2024-03-24T22:13:44Z,Learn to code bros been silent since this banger dropped
2024-03-24T21:52:54Z,This fvcking shit gonna ruin software engineer's life
2024-03-24T20:54:50Z,I have 2 words for you
2024-03-24T20:37:49Z,People Should be fu*ck chat gpt and Devin and ai and you
2024-03-24T19:12:10Z,This is fantatic! Who cares about the woke whiners (they can go back to plowing and sowing by hand. Somehow they never whine about cheaper goods from china). Machines have always taken away manpower in history. This is like the industrialization for the IT sector.
2024-03-24T18:34:50Z,It’s a shame to produce an AI like this. You will end your own career
2024-03-24T18:23:25Z,"Do you guys imagine whats gonna happen after every job is taken by ai robots ?
I think the riches will be very very rich and others ......?😢"
2024-03-24T17:55:42Z,"I repeat learn AI to defeat it, Coz AI is not gonna eat your job but the person using AI is gonna do that."
2024-03-24T17:18:17Z,Thanks for destroying our future and ruining 4 years of cse. Screw u
2024-03-24T16:52:38Z,Not replacing programmer but make them paid less
2024-03-24T16:21:48Z,Imagine figure + Devin AI and think about both logo dude💀💀☠☠
2024-03-24T16:18:15Z,"First Wuhan, now wu"
2024-03-24T15:15:03Z,"People forgot how they got creativity, Is your grandma who helps you do everything or your life which forces you face everything. AI won't make us focus more interesting things or make the civilization better. It will only lower our intelligence to a point we won't be able to tell their mistakes. They might never revolt us, but they will end us in a sweet honey way."
2024-03-24T14:46:34Z,"to the all devs, devin is another tools for us. it's an advantage to learn more and build more thing. at least for me it is..i'm looking forward to get access"
2024-03-24T14:44:42Z,"Programming languages have been developed to facilitate human interaction with machines, streamlining complex tasks into comprehensible instructions. However, when it comes to machine-to-machine communication, there's a question as to whether they should undergo the same process of using elaborate programming languages. Alternatively, machines could potentially communicate using a more straightforward and universal language, simplifying the exchange of information."

2024-03-24T14:14:27Z,I'm learning coding at a community college. Now my career is ove and i lost all my money
2024-03-24T12:35:38Z,devin ai please  i want to use it
2024-03-24T12:17:25Z,This is too strong doing programming with our brain is good but using this its totally losing human mind na im not gonna use this im ok doing programming with my own brain
2024-03-24T11:51:20Z,Glad ai is not talking out deva until 2050 😂
2024-03-24T09:24:51Z,Sir we hate you

They are either far away from what they show in this video or desperately losing."
2024-03-24T05:32:19Z,Hehe funny
2024-03-24T02:04:11Z,AI will only replace developers if there is widespread trust and acceptance of AI tools' capabilities and reliability.
2024-03-24T00:39:48Z,I will still learn computer science because i am interested in it and create problems that Devin can't solve
2024-03-24T00:29:27Z,Why are you automating away your own job?
2024-03-23T22:32:34Z,"i think others have probably said this before... AI is an upcoming ""industrial revolution""... like other ""industrial revolution"" that came before... some jobs would become obsolete... but there will be new job opportunities that weren't available before the arrival of AI... if automation is an efficient way to increase productivity over repetitive tasks, then AI would 1 day update its own codes... like deciding evolution of its own species..."
2024-03-23T19:18:09Z,This guys doesnt let we engineers live was worried about layoffs then they introduced this devin with a smile for what making us unemployed
2024-03-23T18:49:08Z,Why would Devin need to show all windows like debugging 😀.
2024-03-23T16:02:38Z,Now learn hacking and hacked devin
2024-03-23T15:22:37Z,"well that's how as a software developer  I debug problems using print statement. A proper documentation with such AI will surely leave thibgs for review. Well, you could surely add a thing or two for documentation i.e. formatting, template, etc."
2024-03-23T14:09:13Z,"If we upload wrong code to GitHub then devin will fail in his accurcy. 
We are know that Devin used GitHub 😮"
2024-03-23T11:13:51Z,This is what you get when you voluntarily give all of your data and code to Microsoft and other Big Tech companies. They just use it to train their AI models and thank you by taking your job
2024-03-23T11:12:13Z,"My one and only skill, 😪💔"

F**k You 🤬"

2024-03-22T19:23:40Z,I'm terrified
2024-03-22T17:54:19Z,Not devin vut devil for software engineers especially front end developers
2024-03-22T17:51:08Z,"Well automation at any place likely to happen with time will make more people out of jobs than working or earning less than usual.This will reduce demand for things due to less spending power of the consumers which will either result in a cheaper world or business shutdowns.

2024-03-22T17:12:12Z,"should Ban This Devin AI,this will destroy economy"
2024-03-22T16:27:33Z,Can I please request access to try it out? Thanks
2024-03-22T15:45:38Z,how I can access devin ?

2024-03-22T08:42:54Z,Scott Wu will screw us
2024-03-22T08:17:33Z,when is devin is going to available
2024-03-22T08:07:12Z,"I like how it's written below his name ""Human software engineer"", as if it's necessary in today's world to display that."
2024-03-22T07:34:29Z,India in shambles😂
2024-03-22T07:07:14Z,"solution for this critical headache just turn off the transformer😝do it frequently then they will hire the human, in future we may facing shortage of water and food its better focuse on that side too. we cant eat motherboard in future."
2024-03-22T04:50:03Z,we should ban this Devil or Devin this company is hell
2024-03-22T04:46:54Z,Who will fix Devin's bugs?
2024-03-22T04:34:16Z,"Me:- *My Future is Secure* 😎
Devin:- *Hi* 😐"
2024-03-22T04:31:48Z,"Guys, we don't need to be afraid of Davin, Daven can't do any harm to us, it can hurt only those who are job holders, we are already jobless 😁"
2024-03-22T04:22:56Z,"people like him are the real culprit , they learnt from this field and became enemies for its fellow generation still you wanna call us family, you POS , for your own companies benefit you made something which will snatch somebodies bread and butter"
2024-03-22T01:47:24Z,losing to a fucking devin
2024-03-22T01:35:18Z,"Solace anyone, in that was a fucking ugly website?"
2024-03-22T01:09:55Z,Devin created Devin
2024-03-21T21:32:09Z,"Bro, I’m an AI researcher, not a software engineer, but that sounds like friendly fire if u ask me"
2024-03-21T21:03:31Z,Alright i want this
2024-03-21T20:53:57Z,Who else thinks he looks like the lady that says “you are now one of my elite employees” lol
2024-03-21T20:10:41Z,Hi Sir Can it be used in Android😅
2024-03-21T18:02:43Z,"AI will be an assistant to programmers just like any other tool. Programming is not just about writing code but also about solving new problems using critical thinking , collaboration and continuous improvements   .

What is currently happening is marketing a happy flow to cope up with completion in the AI market and to get VC funded"
2024-03-21T17:49:13Z,I think Devin is gay
2024-03-21T17:40:47Z,Devin is mogging all the human software engineers
2024-03-21T15:16:05Z,"If you have already made  an AI software engineer.
Then why don't you create an organization from it and create lots of software applications. 
You revealed an incomplete project just to take credit and enter the world record. 
🖕"
2024-03-21T15:14:47Z,I just started this 😭😭😭
2024-03-21T15:13:01Z,"Oo My God What do I do now? I am a new coder. 
BCA Student"
2024-03-21T15:10:19Z,"Hey devin I'm not afraid of you, 
You know why!"
2024-03-21T14:47:56Z,Why the fuck you are so happy announcing this shit which will make people loose jobs and go in depression and increase the crime rates . You aren't making world a better place.
2024-03-21T14:41:26Z,Yea fuck your company
2024-03-21T13:08:14Z,Still software engineer have chance by changing into doctor job
2024-03-21T09:47:54Z,Can devin copy paste the code from stackoverflow?
2024-03-21T09:44:42Z,"Why you people targeting people  job? It's not good ...
Final stage people who created must also loose the job..."
2024-03-21T09:42:50Z,If everyone is unemployed... who will purchase any software products??...
2024-03-21T09:42:03Z,Why we need it? It's creating unemployment all over the globe ... its not helping the society.....
2024-03-21T08:56:57Z,"please add me to your waiting list, thank you."
2024-03-21T08:42:48Z,They should have named it devil.
2024-03-21T08:02:49Z,just a GIMMICK and nothing more
2024-03-21T06:43:26Z,but... 'Devin.... whadda you doin ere?! I think you should go home'
2024-03-21T05:53:36Z,What is Scott Wu smiling about?
2024-03-21T05:45:59Z,"i wonder if people saying ""AI will take off our jobs"" do actually have jobs at the mooment?"
2024-03-21T04:55:54Z,don't worry guy's behind Devin there is a Human!
2024-03-21T03:54:35Z,All these people crying about technology in society advancing 😂😂 they want society to advance enough for everybody to need software engineers but not enough to have AI do it
2024-03-21T02:58:17Z,WTF devin sucking guy replace our jobs
2024-03-21T02:57:14Z,"its dangerous bro, if it becomes for intelligent than most of humans..🫥🫥"
2024-03-20T22:46:16Z,All of this requires product/project managers that can actually clearly articulate requirements…. I’ve been doing this job for a long time now and it requires a certain amount of reading between the lines and seeking clarification. These tools will be great for experienced devs but I’m willing to bet any company who goes all in on something like this will fail fast.
2024-03-20T19:30:51Z,I really thought about this when i tried to learn programing and now its become true by AI
2024-03-20T18:47:24Z,You are responsible for destroying survival of our Family 😢
2024-03-20T17:49:07Z,His glasses so thickly powered
2024-03-20T17:43:37Z,"His smile mean something to me, I started learning web-dev this year, now this Devin !! I recently filled police form, out of the curiosity, I am need to start studying.🙂🙂🙂🙂"
2024-03-20T17:42:55Z,I'm thinking to invest in my own start up rather than being graduate till 2025 😢
2024-03-20T17:18:16Z,"when I watch the low volumes on the stock market, artificial intelligence does not worry me as much as the lack of liquidity, which will probably put more people out of work in a much shorter time."
2024-03-20T16:45:25Z,Imagine Devin doing your job while your boss paints your toe nails.
2024-03-20T16:12:41Z,Dislikes of this video shows that how much people are really  frustrated from this f*ucking Devin AI
2024-03-20T15:45:31Z,THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME LOOSING HOPE FOR MY PROGRAMMER FUTURE.🤬 THIS IT GARBAGE
2024-03-20T15:33:20Z,NOW I AM GOING TO CHANGE MY FACULTY 😢
2024-03-20T15:31:47Z,Scott Wu has such a punchable face.
2024-03-20T15:27:09Z,"The developer who created the AI already benefits from it, so they don't give a shit if other developers are losing their jobs because of it."
2024-03-20T15:22:37Z,Bro is pushing the workforce back to agriculture
2024-03-20T15:00:43Z,"I tired to get a program on chatgpt and gemini, just to sort an integer array. Even after multiple attempts, both failed to deliver a right code. So kind of surprised that the above can do so many things. 
In my view all these will become , addons tools to current programmers, but i do not see them replacing a human.
Thats my take on this, with the observation and results i saw this far.

If they really work so good, than there is no need of any senate and president etc, all can be replaced by AI. Am i not right?"
2024-03-20T15:00:29Z,One word that will suit is ridiculous invention
2024-03-20T14:37:17Z,This thing shouldn't be like full in paid version otherwise fuck you shit cognition ----/////

2024-03-20T14:30:08Z,"People then : We will make technologies to help humans and make world a better place. 

People now :"

2024-03-20T13:28:13Z,"Client: ""Devin can you make website for my cakeshop!""
Devin: ""Of course which web framework and packages you want to use? There is Nextjs, Angular, or Laravel with postgre, you choose""
Client: ""Huuh...?""

Dont worry folks, your job secure, at least this year"
2024-03-20T13:17:39Z,"I just started my career in coding as a Salesforce developer. After seeing this, I'm very confused about whether to continue as a Salesforce developer or quit and pursue a job in the electrical engineering domain, as I am an electrical engineer. After all, I am in my 30s, and there are still about 30 years left in my career where I need to work. At this stage, I am able to switch, but not after a few years"
2024-03-20T12:24:53Z,Hey.
2024-03-20T12:17:29Z,"What happens if Devin misunderstands one of the instructions or feeds off from wrong data somewhere along the line? The developer would need to try to reverse engineer the entire process and find out first what Devin was trying to do, what the mistake was, how it can be solved, and then try to integrate that into Devin's solution. This is the issue not only with Devin but also with AI in general, including ChatGPT. There is a running joke about ""coding"" in 2 minutes with AI and debugging for hours, and that it is true. These tools are useful, at the moment, only for simple pieces of code, like creating a boilerplate for a React component, a basic database, generating mock data, etc., but no real programmer would use them to build something that requires deep critical thinking and metacognition. Am I saying that these tools will not get better? No. But let's consider that evolution happens in both ways (humans and robots). Two years ago, junior developers would proudly build a simple calculator or a one-page HTML and JavaScript page and make it the focus of their portfolio. Today, with the current tools, a junior developer can easily apply knowledge of APIs, databases, frameworks, etc., to build a CRUD application in a matter of weeks/days. As these machines get smarter, human beings are also getting more competent at building more complex projects and liberating their time to think and truly innovate, building products that are useful and impactful. We have a very exciting future ahead of us."
2024-03-20T12:05:12Z,Software engineers are the killer of software engineers
2024-03-20T11:53:11Z,We should limit the ai into some specific fields …that will not ruin our jobs 😅
2024-03-20T11:42:38Z,"Brooo, i fucked up when i choose full stack...fk u Devin"
2024-03-20T10:21:10Z,"Please don't make this type of any ai just use it for yourself and don't ruin all the work of engineers.
we don't want this advancement."
2024-03-20T10:16:49Z,Is Devin just a hacked-up gpt-pilot from 2023 coming back to haunt us?
2024-03-20T08:49:35Z,"Bro first took the job of calculator(if you know) and now trying to take ours(software engineers)😕😬
DEVIN is the new devil"
2024-03-20T08:36:57Z,Most Hated Person right now 💀

2024-03-20T06:55:04Z,Dont be cool with AI it is far dangerous for humankind.... Life before advancement is very relaxed but now see the faces in stressed and tension
2024-03-20T06:52:39Z,Thanks for ruining fresher and students life who wants to start coding career like me.....i just completed my mern stack development course and i wasted my money 😢
2024-03-20T06:10:29Z,"2014: ""learn how to code old man lol 😂""

2024: ""learn how to weld old man lol 😂"""
2024-03-20T05:54:21Z,The next version will be called DeviL. 😂 Don't worry this is not the end of the programmers job. It will make it easier. If you still want to study for a programmer the best jobs right now would be in the AI area. It will be interesting if this model starts to improve by itself.
2024-03-20T05:17:38Z,how do I get access? Im trying to replace 10 or 20 code monkeys who contribute very little to my product. this will save me money
2024-03-20T04:59:22Z,Software made by evil people. Look at his demonic face
2024-03-20T04:41:30Z,Just another Chat GPT tool with metal body and fake eyes
2024-03-20T02:56:34Z,"I don’t think it is the end of software engineering.  Very few people of the street can use Devon, you must be a software engineer to use it.  For example, I don’t a person from marketing can take Devon and quickly develop their own CRM system or a baker using Devon to develop a bookkeeping and stock control software.  This is a tool to make software engineers more productive and to focus on the algo development and application side of IT."
2024-03-20T01:37:21Z,I love how Google automatically deletes any threatening comments.  It's truly 1984
2024-03-19T20:44:43Z,Any failed musicians that want to give it another go?
2024-03-19T20:41:19Z,I hate this man 😠
2024-03-19T20:30:05Z,Your programmers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.
2024-03-19T20:04:31Z,"If this scares you out of software dev, good. Because that means that software dev is not for you. I'm tired of all the mercs in this industry.
This will never replace the vast majority of dev jobs."
2024-03-19T19:50:04Z,so when we can use it and what's the cost?
2024-03-19T19:05:30Z,"hey man, with yours ai engineer we can do better ai engineer systems like yours and that stuff will be obsolete in a few days. good luck on the way to trying pissing on the developers. dna is most flexibile thing and we humans are based on that principle. without general ai there is no chance to replace real devs with intuition, soft skills and flexibility. Cycle of ai generating better ai and more cooperating ai specs. clusters starts now."
2024-03-19T18:24:53Z,"Hey, I actually had an idea earlier today that might be a helpful benchmark, a speech assistance program/app. I have heard of cough drops as an existing option, although I would imagine Devin could do multiple languages that humans might not have the skill set combination to do."
2024-03-19T18:00:43Z,"Now I want to see AI jump into a complex web application that's been around for 7-8 years with tons of hands on it, and make tweaks to an existing feature. Building things from scratch without having to deal with code debt, cruft, existing interdependencies etc, isn't really impressive to me."
2024-03-19T17:28:59Z,"F*** Devin and cognition button😡🤬

2024-03-19T17:06:48Z,I am university student and I would like to try Devin so could you please see my request
2024-03-19T17:00:33Z,Can Devin train a Model where it can detect corrupt public officials?
2024-03-19T15:57:39Z,"Want to speak to the founder of Cognition Company. All of you are making AI tools like Devin software engineer. Many people are becoming unemployed. If you are such a big coder, then with the help of AI you can create a new planet or arrangement for living there in the universe. Why don't you find a new planet? AI will do whatever people are doing, you are just stuck in it. Find a new planet and do all this. Then you will be called a big person. you all are bulls"
2024-03-19T15:42:47Z,"Ohh so all the time we were just echoing devins words?
Hello world"

2024-03-19T14:25:58Z,Man this is all bullcrap most probably it would do nothing more than assisting devs. Otherwise it would lay the ground work for another communist revolution.
2024-03-19T13:48:07Z,People be doing crazy things for some money bro. Someone stop that guy!💀
2024-03-19T13:17:16Z,"How foolish are people? Especially these ones. Software developers who seek to eliminate other software developers. Nowadays, technological progress seems to be the most important thing in life, the endless optimization of every process becoming the essence of many people's lives. When one mentally spins the wheel further, the life of each individual becomes insignificant and thus unnecessary, as with technological progress, the meaning and existence of every person can be abstracted away and replaced by AI and robots. Even those who believe they are at the top and in the end only have to push buttons.

The deployment and development of AI can be a blessing to humanity, generating prosperity and relieving humanity, thereby releasing resources. But it will turn out differently because individual humans are greedy. They will, for the sake of profit, leave everything and everyone beneath them in the dust, causing chaos and misery.

In other words, we deserve it."
2024-03-19T13:04:26Z,I'm so excited about this. Could you let me try I will provide my feedback
2024-03-19T12:34:55Z,Scott looks you in the eye and smiles as he knows he completely rendered you useless and took away your career
2024-03-19T12:31:52Z,"They just made another tool(like visual studio :)) and portraying this like they have made a human mind. Nice marketing strategy!! Trust me guys this is nothing and don't worry. Suppose you have 10 thousand lines of code and there is an error somewhere in the code, what the hell devin will do in that and what about the logics which human mind did in the code?"
2024-03-19T11:17:50Z,Devin is the guy she told you not to worry about.
2024-03-19T10:55:21Z,"Hi, how do I get access to Devin please?  I've written a chess emulator to prove that harnessing a machine is better than a human.  And it's true it can now beat me.  Once it was completed, I asked ChatGPT to write the Min-Max algorithm in C# and yes it was very very similar to what I had built.   To take it to the next level the program needs to multi-thread (for performance).   At this point both ChatGPT and I have struggled (I'm not a full time developer but I was once).  Would be interested to see how Devin gets on."
2024-03-19T10:28:59Z,Requesting Devin
2024-03-19T08:16:03Z,"AI yet hasn't replaced any writer, how it will replace a Programmer?"

2024-03-19T07:30:04Z,"hi, I need some more detailed information. also to learn it properly is there any free on line course ?"
2024-03-19T07:26:26Z,I guess the way now is to become an AI developer until we make an AI than can develop new AI 😳

2024-03-18T13:52:03Z,"this is what happens when you are a worker without any knownlodge of the working class struggle, you can destroy families and futures with a smile on your face thinking you are doing an amazing job

2024-03-18T13:30:46Z,"If you are worried about Ai taking your job, tell me how are they going to solve the issue of vagueness? Think about it.
Natural language is subject to many different interpretations. Once the prompt gets complex, there are ten million different interpretations.
Second, how do you trust Ai has done the changes without impacting your existing flow? 
You would say ""testing""
Is this a full proof? 
How would you ensure that ai has not introduced security issues?
Now what about scalability?
What about configurations? 
You can't even describe all these to ai unless you are a programmer.
What about choosing the right technologies for a project?

I know you would say that ai is going to become so powerful that it would take care of all these things.

Still, knowing programming will give you an advantage over people who don't. You can utilize this new technologies to increase productivity.
I see it as an augmentation because human consciousness is going to be required and that's something humans can't create and will never have the means to do so."

2024-03-17T21:54:01Z,"It's probably been mentioned before, but it's crucial to note that Devin is not 'the first AI software engineer.' Other initiatives, such as GPT-Pilot and MetaGPT, precede it, making such a claim inaccurate and potentially misleading. Additionally, it's important to distinguish that Devin operates as an agent, not a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4. Therefore, comparing its performance directly to LLMs might not be appropriate. While Devin represents an innovative integration of existing technologies, providing accurate and clear information is essential to maintain trust and credibility.

2024-03-17T21:03:18Z,How are they asking us to critique the machine that is taking away jobs.Walmart didn't even ask the cashiers how to make self check out better.I am completly baffled by this world anymore.

2024-03-17T20:01:35Z,"Technology is suppose to assist human, not replace human.
This is like building a gun in early human world. See, building gun led to what.
Somethings are not supposed to be build. Millions of family investing fortune and loans in their life, study and career wiped off by this. Happy coding.
This will not only reduce the low quality devs but every quality dev, even the best since AI evolve exponentially."
2024-03-17T19:39:19Z,i give humans 2 years after this 😂
2024-03-17T19:28:53Z,I will make another AI to replace Devin

2024-03-17T17:03:58Z,Similar to chatGPT
2024-03-17T16:58:32Z,"I am thinking what is the aim of AI like this in general ? To make ppl happier or to kill ppl passion ? At the end everyone will lose their jobs because  AI will be able to do everything in every profession, soo who will be e.g. buying AI products ? :D"
2024-03-17T16:36:24Z,"Okay i was super confident before watching this video, but now seeing what Devin can do, i'm kinda freaked out. But i remain confident and focus cause what's sure is AI will never completely make we software engineers obselete, even Devin or any other AI tool needs engineers for updates and maintenance and even for utility. Software Engineers will always be of relevance in this world!"
2024-03-17T16:28:28Z,i've just graduated from a coding bootcamp. thanks for creating a new assistant for me🎉
2024-03-17T15:49:28Z,"sad but impressive, as a fullt stack developer I fear fucking Davin"
2024-03-17T15:41:02Z,"Good sales pitch. Horrible reality check. 

Nothing on the video addressees real world applicable job tasks in any software engineering position. Secondly, as (again) it was proven, current AI, including Devin, lack sooo much when compared to even a junior developer, that saying ""first AI software engineer"" would be like saying someone that just learned their first 3 tags of HTML can not claim to be a software engineer. 

What you are actually creating here is a fallacy and fake news that does indeed have a negative impact on students in the area by making them think, there is no need to stufy software anymore. For junior devs, by making them think AI can replace middle to complex tasks that need a lot of thinking.

The only ones that care about this would be senior developers with years of experience and professors in the area because they know the impact of it, good and bad. Socially related, work related and knowledge related."

2024-03-17T15:11:26Z,"Instead of linear planning, you should develop a tree-like project management API that organizes projects and tasks in a hierarchical, tree-like structure (just like how folders are organized on a filesystem).

2024-03-17T14:39:34Z,"Look, the courts have already ruled you have no ip claims on AI generated code. This means Devin is going to struggle to find traction in companies where ip is important.

2024-03-17T13:40:37Z,Hi! I made a phone app called Gig Boss to help freelancers organize their careers. Could Devin build us a web app that communicates seamlessly with the phone app?

2024-03-15T12:39:04Z,If writing your own termination letter had a face 😂😂😂
2024-03-15T12:32:04Z,F*** u Devin i cannot pay my rent anymore
2024-03-15T12:16:12Z,"I'm super excited about this. We tried building a proof of concept for something similar in IBM but never got approval or budgeting. This was pre-Covid though, before the recent AI craze.

Would definitely love to try this out."
2024-03-15T11:50:58Z,I wish from my gut that these guys who created this shit never get to feel happiness in their whole life. Thanks for ruining everything
2024-03-15T11:50:39Z,"Love how far code generation has come, but does it generate any human reviewable tests that the code is tested against? It's generating a nice graph but it's kind of hard to know if it's accurate without reviewing every line of code, which we don't want to do. A few layers of tests could help alleviate that problem."
2024-03-15T11:46:30Z,pls hack this anoymous😂😂😂
2024-03-15T11:11:52Z,Bhai abhe to job bhe nhe mili !
2024-03-15T11:11:00Z,There is nothing wonderful about this AI software engineer it will kill jobs. All you and your friends care about is making money of your service. One day your own service will fuck you over.
2024-03-15T10:54:53Z,Why not ASSHOLE another AI to make people die I am hoping this AI turns itself and F2345678
2024-03-15T10:54:39Z,*Human software Engineer*......it has started
2024-03-15T10:54:05Z,Among creatures only human beings is that wked that he can even create what will kill him in quest for wealth
2024-03-15T10:43:49Z,"For real im just starting learn about coding and wth is this,can anyone tell me it will not gonna replace us"
2024-03-15T10:26:15Z,"I’d be interested to see the full conversation log used in this demo — there’s quite a lot of prompting from Scott, if you pay attention. When Scott says “Devin decided to make a website”, you can see that Scott told Devin what to put on that website and we don’t know what suggestions he made before that…"
2024-03-15T09:48:13Z,Thanks ❤
2024-03-15T09:29:18Z,Devin will not replace you. Don't believe in that. Keep learning. Use it as assistant to save your time. All AI powered tools are helping you but not replacing you.
2024-03-15T09:23:12Z,0:52 If Devin is an Ai Then How he face error in his code??? Isn't he should write error free code at First attempt??
2024-03-15T09:15:47Z,I wish to try Devin. how to I try it?
2024-03-15T09:08:22Z,is it just me or they intentionally misspelled Devil ?
2024-03-15T09:06:20Z,It's time to find Morpheus and Neo ... who will save us from agents like this 😀
2024-03-15T08:28:38Z,The only part that is we can't make DEVIN... Because of VC's funding millions of dollars worth GPU and petabytes of free training data they have.... Coding is a game of rich... Always has been
2024-03-15T08:20:37Z,Exposed 💀🤡
2024-03-15T08:05:49Z,"I need to feed my wife and kids, please delete Devin and never speak of this again.."
2024-03-15T08:04:52Z,l so wanna try this it this thing sounds fantastic
2024-03-15T07:37:49Z,So cool. Do you plan to attach Devin directly to a Debugger so that he can omit using print statements in the future?
2024-03-15T07:36:07Z,I'm really excited to try it and see how it works... Let me know where/how can I try out my own!!
2024-03-15T07:27:12Z,We're not fighting each other 😢 why 🙂?
2024-03-15T07:13:37Z,Scott Wu just became the most hated person on the Internet lol ...
2024-03-15T07:04:06Z,I think its time to talk about a universal basic income😂
2024-03-15T06:57:48Z,I tried submitting my e-mail and it just says we can't do that right now.
2024-03-15T06:37:00Z,"Coding will be dead in 10 years. Only people with deep coding experience will be able to get these models to design enterprise level stuff. ""No fate"" 👈 Soon AI will be saying I am replacing humans."
2024-03-15T06:34:41Z,"but why ?
why public need this ?"
2024-03-15T06:33:55Z,"Coding will be dead in 10 years. Only people with deep coding experience will be able to get these models to design enterprise level stuff. ""No fate"" 👈 Soon AI will be saying I am replacing humans."
2024-03-15T06:25:51Z,"For everyone who is impressed by recent ""AI"" breakthroughs, you may calm down and continue to learn program languages and CS.
1. Read about Model Collapse to understand how greedy generative AI for human data (flooding internet with generative data will ruin the whole concept)
2. Research why current LLMs will never be able to solve math and physics problems harder than 5-8 grade (it cannot do math and logical reasoning)
3. Those people need to constantly feed an army of thousands low skilled workers to map training data (there is a high chance that those workers will put a garbage in training data, as wikipedia already contains a bunch of garbage data)
4. You cannot trust what those models generate
5. Those models will be capable to solve simple problems with 0 guarantee that the solution covers all edge cases and will be running in optimal way. 
6. At this point improving accuracy by 1% for any model would require to increase computational power and consumption by 50% to 100% percent.
7. These demos are filmed in a similar way as Tesla presented, so called, FSD. And where are we now? 100B investment, ""revolution in tech"" and 0 output with FSD.
8. People behind the technology know this, but they will be doing whatever they need to prop their stock prices and grab as much money as they can.

If you think I'm wrong and technology will improve, well, think deeply and learn how LLMs work. These are pure machine learning algorithms involving multiplication of large matrices. It will produce errors by design no matter how large the model is and one error is enough to destroy a life, a company... you name it.

The LLMs and similar ML models will be good in generating some high demand pictures and video in adult industry, spamming internet and faking facts, so most people will not know what to believe. The rest of the output is just worthless and low paid garbage."
2024-03-15T06:23:28Z,People! It's on us. Just stop training the AI by not asking questions and It'll never be smart. Don't use their demo and let them run out of money too.
2024-03-15T06:22:10Z,"From this video, all I understand is that Devin is software that uses AI and actual human software engineers (users) to make software. In that sense, it only takes jobs from those engineers who aren't able to use AI correctly.
 
""Please correct me if I am wrong about Devin""."
2024-03-15T06:16:52Z,Problem is it's not free to use like Bard and it's next version
2024-03-15T06:04:28Z,"you idiots, congratulations you've engineered your own replacements"
2024-03-15T05:19:15Z,"I want to try Devin , so where can I get this"
2024-03-15T04:58:31Z,"Hey, 
I'm curious about Devin. I would love to use it in my day to day work. We as human comes very very in the area of technology.....
I'm thinking what next.....
I'm very very excited.....
Congratulations 🎉🎉cognition for this tremendous growth....."
2024-03-15T04:51:19Z,Ai engineering is best for future
2024-03-15T04:28:14Z,"If it really needs debugging print statement to debug the ""KeyError"", then guys we're safe 🎉"
2024-03-15T04:19:35Z,How can I axis devin ai
2024-03-15T03:32:56Z,What will society look like when AI Agents replace majority of people? We move to UBI or we all just become homeless and live under a bridge?
2024-03-15T03:05:35Z,@coginstion-labs It's my humble request can I try devin ai also I can give u proper review
2024-03-15T03:00:18Z,It is possible to try devin ? Would like to request thank 🙏
2024-03-15T02:57:17Z,So what else human going do if AI and Robots doing everything!
2024-03-15T02:47:01Z,"Finally something truly coming to help us, who are scared of coding, highly appreciated ❤"
2024-03-15T02:04:45Z,Chinese dude would be unemployed first.
2024-03-15T02:04:15Z,"If Ai will overcome the Human work force , then our governments will take taxes from AI 😂😂"
2024-03-15T02:00:48Z,I want to use it
2024-03-15T01:57:47Z,"Me - Dad , Did granpa left some large piece of land for us"
2024-03-15T01:27:52Z,Why even create this....
2024-03-15T01:17:57Z,How can i use devin
2024-03-15T01:00:48Z,I want to use
2024-03-15T00:29:19Z,I hate you you are eating my job 😢
2024-03-15T00:28:29Z,My corporate is thinking to build a software development team for a new IoT project and this Devin AI is quite interesting as a solution.  How to use it code a cloud self serve video/image portal and send the media to any tablets inside the company network.  Who or what title or background can manage the Devin AI for the whole development journey. Thanks.
2024-03-15T00:13:29Z,What's the thought process here? How many lay offs are you aiming?
2024-03-15T00:10:46Z,I think now we have to defeat Devin AI in coding.
2024-03-15T00:05:46Z,Just went through his one of old tv quiz program where this maniac was solving complex calculations in seconds taking less time than a fuckin calculator.
2024-03-15T00:05:24Z,"Everyone are freaking out that it will take their jobs, even though it's essentially not open to the public (probably because it's not as useful / working as well as the video make it seem). 
I'm not excited until I can try it hands on!"
2024-03-15T00:03:17Z,Here comes end of Software Engineers.Thanks Devin for fuckin us so badly.
2024-03-15T00:01:46Z,"You worry too much 😂

I read some takes on Devin and it doesn't seem he would be replacing any software developer soon just keep learning and maybe you can create your own Devin in the nearest future 😅"
2024-03-14T23:51:16Z,I wanna try it!
2024-03-14T23:47:53Z,It was an honour to program with you all
2024-03-14T23:19:22Z,capacity for recursive self-improvement?
2024-03-14T23:16:59Z,Devin is paid ai don't worry guys
2024-03-14T23:04:54Z,I would like to try it in some of my developments. Thanks
2024-03-14T22:57:58Z,Guys? Are we fucked? Can someone reassure me please? 🥲
2024-03-14T22:53:18Z,This will be one of the most hated men in history
2024-03-14T22:40:20Z,Where is the software? I could not find it or test it!
2024-03-14T21:55:43Z,"Scott Wu, CEO and Layoff Engineer "
2024-03-14T21:34:12Z,"Finally, someone to do my coding homework. Sign me up"
2024-03-14T21:31:20Z,How dumb you need to be to make your own replacement??? 😅😅😅
2024-03-14T21:27:55Z,"Bull shit, No Ai, these are Indians that doing things on backend. Like a call center type shit."
2024-03-14T21:25:29Z,"Here was 540k views in the morning of 14.03, Youtube make it lower"
2024-03-14T21:18:18Z,Can Devin help me with my Online sales forecasting project?
2024-03-14T21:16:44Z,I can see why they named it Devin
2024-03-14T20:57:30Z,so much AI hype
2024-03-14T20:43:18Z,Devin has his own console... Is it a new framework that uses natural language? So the devs continued to exist. 😅
2024-03-14T20:37:26Z,We are going back to the farm
2024-03-14T20:25:13Z,Crazy - Can I try it
2024-03-14T20:18:24Z,Can you create an algorithm in TOMP which dispatches many tot many requests for public transport (small busses)?
2024-03-14T20:13:12Z,"Thanks to Devin. Now there'll be less competition in the job market, less bidding in free lancing projects and more demand of Good developers. Because Devin might have scared lot of people, some might not even start programing at the first place thinking AI will take your job and some will quit😂"
2024-03-14T19:25:55Z,"Yeah... exactly what world society needs now... Self-enhancing softwares .... that potentially (certainly?) could lead the society in mid/long-term into inumerous very bad dystopic scenarios, its just need to have some basic 'Greater vision' perspective and common sense to visualize that (e.g imagine future super malwares, robots with this kind of softwares, cof cof....). And what I said I dont even refered about the obvious job-market aspect... Applauses for totally missing Ethics looking only for money-grubbing for a few, congratulations (sarcasm). What upsett me most, is they are helping dooming our society (and themselves) with a open smiles on their faces."
2024-03-14T19:17:42Z,Now this is where “They took errrh jeeerbs!!” a literal step further.
2024-03-14T19:15:53Z,"Please , I will like to try it"

2024-03-14T19:03:57Z,i didn't go to school for 2 years of doing nothing for years and years to get my potential job took by a robot. This worlds a fucking joke.
2024-03-14T18:44:47Z,"Hi, I have a request for Devin:
Create a daily trading plan that will scan for stocks in an up trend, close and above the 20 daily moving average, with increasing buys volume (ideally after reduced sellers volume), RSI not in the top, and the candle is positive. Create a list of these stocks. Get latest news for these stocks and create an investment chance for success"
2024-03-14T18:36:16Z,Human software Engineer 😭😭
2024-03-14T17:47:25Z,Bro competition already tough why these guys making our bread and butter under knife. Imagine loosing your job because of our extra brain 😢😢

2024-03-14T16:30:25Z,"People laughing at me for using ""print"" statements to debug my code - where are you now? Stop hiding under the table and apologize rn."
2024-03-14T15:50:00Z,"The least we can do is stop giving these ""technologies"" human names.  Lets give them alternate names so that when were in dicussion about these technologies, it doesnt confuse people.

2024-03-14T15:38:25Z,You devs better take a page from the Luddites and start sabotaging this shit.

2024-03-14T12:55:57Z,It's sounds like DEVIL to me!!
2024-03-14T12:53:58Z,Imagine Devin's dev team got fired because Devin replaced them.
2024-03-14T12:48:54Z,Lol this only an GPT MODEL WITH EXTRA FEATURES  it's company marketing to gain popularity that's why it's name is ai software engineer

We need jobs please don't make anything which not help millions family. It takes many families food ,joy, enjoyment and that's situation many humans try to suicide attempt"
2024-03-14T12:03:36Z,Its a cycle if corporates who earn from customers(we developers are also there) who pay them from worldwide. If we dont have money to pay for any product services how  big giants going to pay for devin or survive in business. Even if big giants would use this development tool for fast developments at the end they will not find anyone to buy their products eventually they will also be out of business.
2024-03-14T12:03:16Z,Crazy that you raised 21 million for essentially making a closed-source clone of Aider.

We've finally put the first milestone to stop the slavery that every commercial person is experiencing when working in a digital company.

2024-03-14T11:46:11Z,How long did Devin take to complete this task? It seemed like there were a lot of feedback prompts.
2024-03-14T11:42:47Z,"No panic, you still have to be technical to give commands to this thing and guide it through the small details only engineers can understand"

2024-03-14T08:54:03Z,do they share the code on github?
2024-03-14T08:51:37Z,Hoe to access this platform?
2024-03-14T08:40:27Z,"Why are after our jobs?

 We don't get paid enough already. Just barely surviving. 😢"
2024-03-14T08:33:24Z,Really man just like that you want to fuc us up huh?
2024-03-14T08:32:59Z,"I have a question regarding ""HUMAN software engineer""?!
What do you mean human? Blink twice if you need help and AGI has already taken control of you"
2024-03-14T08:21:08Z,40 hours work a week is no more in the future
2024-03-14T08:15:22Z,What the fuck human need in world after devin
2024-03-14T08:12:49Z,"Great, can it code Unity?"
2024-03-14T07:57:07Z,"I am waiting for it, please count me in !"
2024-03-14T07:50:06Z,"Devin just layed off Scot and took his wife out with Scott's AI Electric Car.. who knows what Devin will be able to do after the end of the dinner, using his AI capabilities 😉"
2024-03-14T07:49:33Z,"If devin replace human jobs then devins only buy house,car and fly world with devins . What purpose of human in the world ???"
2024-03-14T07:47:21Z,Actually this looks like they are offering software engineers a TOOL!
2024-03-14T07:47:04Z,All bs to steal/squeeze some money from investors. Highly doubt this is better than anything on the market today
2024-03-14T07:42:17Z,Thing is it can't run on its own. So it's likely and obvious that someone having experience in software development would replace the human developers and they might do it for less pay comparing to average software developer. And bigger tech enterprises won't use these AI's since they can't trust them with there code so yeah it will be bad for the average developers. The result will end up coming in less jobs instead of completely replacement.
2024-03-14T07:40:20Z,Why didn't they name it Chad or something
2024-03-14T07:36:52Z,A task for Devin: in C# implement a method that can Base64URL encode a Guid using SIMD. Code should be branchless and no heap allocations are allowed.
2024-03-14T06:39:55Z,When would we get access?
2024-03-14T06:37:48Z,So. *Who wants to start a revolution?*
2024-03-14T06:19:30Z,"Sick, I mean literally sick"
2024-03-14T06:18:45Z,Name should be devil not Devin
2024-03-14T06:18:29Z,How can I request for a trail??
2024-03-14T06:15:43Z,Finally I can die of hunger in a displaced person's camp as the world has been taken over by AI...yayyyy.
2024-03-14T05:53:18Z,That is why we need to start discussing the social impacts and changes needed. The paradigm work - money - pay your bills is rapidly becoming obsolete. Alternatives must be discussed: RBE for example.
2024-03-14T05:46:40Z,"It may be good for a 1-2 page application, but not a big one. In theory, it's good, but it's not very practical in the real world."

2024-03-14T04:33:30Z,dont worried it can`t be replace humans
2024-03-14T04:11:37Z,I want the access if possible
2024-03-14T03:45:26Z,Why are you providing a Google form to request access to Devin?? At least tell Devin to create a proper webpage for the request form 😂
2024-03-14T03:36:07Z,An enemy whose name is Devin
2024-03-14T03:35:03Z,Can i try this?
2024-03-14T03:27:12Z,AI can not steal only one job. That is new creations of theorams in Mathematics.  Because that is only one thing which is not already exists.
2024-03-14T03:01:48Z,"Devin is just a distraction, Scott is the real AI. They're just testing scott in the name of Devin."

2024-03-14T00:37:07Z,Shooting my own foot .
2024-03-14T00:26:28Z,I'd really appreciate Devins help.
2024-03-14T00:18:37Z,Times are changing boys AI won't replace people. People using AI will replace 5 people who don't.
2024-03-13T23:55:46Z,"so, in the future maybe prompt engineering will be more massive and the low-code era will be really risen"
2024-03-13T23:44:04Z,"Everything will be AI, so even business people won’t be needed."
2024-03-13T23:39:41Z,Devin? …. Devil…. There I fixed it
2024-03-13T23:37:59Z,Wait did he just refer to that chart as a website? 🙄
2024-03-13T23:32:14Z,Hopefully Devin only works in demo but not in real world
2024-03-13T22:59:32Z,"I would like to try out Devin on my own real world tasks, currently I do vidoes on multiple channels around AI software development, and this looks intriguing."
2024-03-13T22:17:46Z,"4 months before I graduate as a software engineer, that's what I call luck my friends, wtf horrible timing"
2024-03-13T21:44:31Z,Them glasses so thick they can see the future.
2024-03-13T21:22:55Z,How do we get to try it out?
2024-03-13T21:04:56Z,I would like to code a software that can read all companies financial statements then put all data in an excel sheet.  Can Devin do this? Thanks.
2024-03-13T21:03:27Z,These AI researchers got beef with software engineer. How can you do this to a fellow human being?
2024-03-13T20:48:55Z,ask Devin to do a FAANG coding interview
2024-03-13T20:39:18Z,Programmers working on making programmers obsolete.... awesome... sounds not at all stupid.
2024-03-13T20:05:09Z,"Imagine taking these individuals seriously and feeling concerned about the situation, despite their inability to design even a basic static HTML website without a glaring flaw: an unrestricted file upload field on a simple web form.

In fact, the Reddit community uncovered this vulnerability and exploited it by uploading a plethora of all sort of huge files. Their next Amazon S3 bill surely will be an unpleasant surprise, to say the least.

If AI starts f* around with devs, expect them.

I'm surprised that many developers have yet to recognize that most ""AI startups"" are essentially glorified wrappers for ChatGPT, or rely on custom models derived from open-source models found on platforms like Hugging Face.

Only a handful of companies possess the expertise in disruptive AI, given the substantial computational costs associated with generating production-ready outcomes.

Developers should only begin to worry when AGI emerges, and at that point, the entire world will share their concerns."
2024-03-13T19:57:25Z,software engineers writing the tools to put themselves out of a job smh
2024-03-13T19:47:16Z,Imagine seeing this while updating your skills to find a new job and getting back up on your feet!
2024-03-13T19:44:29Z,"if you are so enthusiastic about AI and afraid to lose your job because of it. try to ask your ""non technical friend"" to use that tool and create not simple application that can live in real world env.
just like some time ago when computers were invented and mathematicians didn't go. demand for mathematicians even increased. same will be for programmers. it's a tool that is very useful for technical people who understand architectural problems and design pros and cons. don't be afraid of AI. it will boost your performance. learn prompt engineering, rags, and other Ai concepts. it's a future. cheers guys!"
2024-03-13T19:38:17Z,"Writing software is the easy part.  The hard part is trying to work out what the user actually wanted in the first place.  Until Devin can do that, our jobs are safe."
2024-03-13T19:35:00Z,"Can I make high level projects using Devin, like integrating one software application to another!"
2024-03-13T19:24:25Z,Sending a request to try Devin.
2024-03-13T19:23:38Z,I hate you Devin 😢
2024-03-13T19:07:48Z,Should I still study programming in college? 👀
2024-03-13T19:03:19Z,BAN this tool and all AI
2024-03-13T18:58:13Z,One team lead with Devin will replace whole team. Cost reduction 5-8x times.
2024-03-13T18:56:09Z,"It's cool, but I wonder how much of it is a prompt engineering pipeline around an AI model (GPT), vs the AI model itself being trained to do stuff. 
From what I understand, the AI brain behind this is just an LLM. For it to actually eval on CMD, someone needs to build a io interface for the GPT model to interact with. At that point, it is feasible to add more sophisticated prompts to try out things like debug statements, etc.

A lot of this is also scaffolding for the human user to gain trust into the AI's actions -- ""showing its work"", by opening browser tabs, etc. Very nice slick UI interface overall, but I'd be interested in understanding if this is just fancy software engineering solution vs a step forward in AI."
2024-03-13T18:43:49Z,I spend my whole childhood cursing Newton for finding gravity and I have to solve complex problems. Now I am cursing open ai and cognition ai
2024-03-13T18:42:04Z,When can I use it? Shut up and take my money.
2024-03-13T18:41:37Z,Why doing this in the first place? You will just leave a lot of people jobless. This is completely unethical.
2024-03-13T18:40:56Z,Its IITianover
2024-03-13T18:36:48Z,Now this is revolution
2024-03-13T18:35:28Z,We're getting closer. The rubicon is when Devin succeeds in creating Devin 2.0.
2024-03-13T18:27:02Z,"It may be a legit product but the video is probably a sham, just like the Gemini video. Why does AI need a code editor or a terminal ? Can't it just ""write"" the code to a file? Can't it just execute commands directly?"
2024-03-13T18:18:12Z,Remember this moment humans. This is a birth of a new age.

2024-03-13T17:42:49Z,devin tf is that name.
2024-03-13T17:39:48Z,What does the code look like that Devin writes? Is it maintainable code?
2024-03-13T17:34:16Z,"cool, all hackers are going to love this!!"
2024-03-13T17:25:40Z,Sounds amazing. I´d love to try
2024-03-13T17:14:36Z,"Here's what's going to happen. A company like this is going to successfully replace us developers with AI, and then we're going to be out of work and poor. The company is going to earn a lot of money and the management are going to be rich. Does it sound familiar?
Why do this to us? Why are humans determined to make life worse?"
2024-03-13T17:13:59Z,"Someday we will look outside and think ""none of this is real""."

2024-03-13T17:08:43Z,Bro is legendary grandmaster 🙏🙏🔥🔥
2024-03-13T17:08:02Z,Alright it’s time to give up on computer science…or atleast Software engineering.
2024-03-13T17:03:22Z,Well fuck. There goes my job.
2024-03-13T16:53:07Z,"Yeah smile through your videos as you threaten to replace everyone and their livelihood.

That'll stop the angry and hungry mob when it inevitably comes for you right?"
2024-03-13T16:52:22Z,I wanna try this cool thing
2024-03-13T16:49:05Z,"the more i see this tools and robots etc, the more reminds me to the oppenheimer movie, he was so naive making a tool that eventually we use to destroy ourselves, AI will be no different except this time it can think by itself"
2024-03-13T16:33:47Z,It's super exciting to see where this is going - I cannot imagine what the progress will look like in 10 years not even to mention 100 years !! Well done to the team at Cognition!
2024-03-13T16:18:17Z,I humbily request access to try out devin on my owen real world tasks

2024-03-13T15:34:53Z,hi. I'm really excited for this. please add me to the waiting list ❤❤
2024-03-13T15:32:15Z,How was a team of devs stupid enough to work on this? I mean it will probably produce garbage once it gets tested on real user requests pretty much like ChatGPT but clueless shareholders will prefer firing thousands of people for this.
2024-03-13T15:22:46Z,Could u please model an AI on the best physicists mathematicians so that we get an AI einstien
2024-03-13T15:19:55Z,We would need Devin running on Quantum computer to fix all glitches in MS Windows and MS Office.
2024-03-13T15:17:33Z,"I don't trust this bullshit. Although I don't doubt that we will reach this level of AI assistant in the future, this company has no reliability, they never showed the product running only the results. Are you also telling me that OpenAI with Microsoft's infinite money can't create something like this, and a bunch of folks in a company that we never knew about did? I don't think so..."
2024-03-13T15:15:16Z,"Thanks to Douglas Adams, we know that the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything is 42. Can Devin calculate the Ultimate Question?"
2024-03-13T14:54:23Z,"Now of course Devin is going to have significant issues.
But this is the folly of people when anything comes out regarding AI. None of it is supposed to be revolutionary, *yet.*
What's important here is the graph at 1:30.
In 1 year and 4 months AI models have gone from being able to resolve 1 in 200 Github repository issues with assistance, to 1 in 7 without assistance.
No matter how good/bad Devin itself is in absolute terms, that progress is stunning.
AI is coming, and anyone who doesn't think so is either not paying attention (not necessarily their fault, that would be our fault for failing to draw people's attention) or is in denial.
Like, sure, they technically could be right, but there's no good reason to think so based on available data."

2024-03-13T13:18:52Z,"Only idiots at companies fire software engineers (or any other jobs) because of AI. (This is called marked-cannibalisation; the more people you make jobless, the more people you kick out from the market, because as their purchasing power gets lost, more and more of your clients will lose their income so you will lose income because you cannibalised your own market.) HR must be embraced, AI can only be productive if it makes humans life better and their AI-assisted work more efficient, instead of making their life unaffordable."
2024-03-13T13:14:19Z,As a corpo dev who’s also a solopreneur at the same time this makes me feel both sad and happy.

Many people with great ideas can now bring their ideas to reality without paying stupid amounts to so called Software Engineers that hardly have time to work for you. Kudos to the developers. I will definitely love to try this out. Please add me to your waiting list.

2024-03-13T08:25:07Z,"I really need to check out Deven, it looks fun."
2024-03-13T08:22:55Z,Where to send the real project data for trial?
2024-03-13T08:22:32Z,A rat never builds a rat trap
2024-03-13T08:19:38Z,Yall remember the learn to code movement?
2024-03-13T08:07:32Z,Would definitely love to give Devin  a try 🫶🏼
2024-03-13T08:02:57Z,I would love to try it please.
2024-03-13T08:02:10Z,how we can test it?
2024-03-13T08:01:36Z,"AI doesn't exist. It's just a well-learned data completion machine. It's not the end of a software engineer, it's just an added tool that you can use as an engineer. It just becomes easier to design and build complete software with these tools.

The replacement of software engineers is a story of the distant future."
2024-03-13T07:56:47Z,i would like to test out Devin
2024-03-13T07:51:06Z,Is this prank like gemini ai? Google also claimed so many stuff. 😒 but running this ai with what cost. 90k for a A100 machine 🤣
2024-03-13T07:49:48Z,"Oh shit, technological singularity has started. We were here and we were alive"
2024-03-13T07:46:12Z,I’m found to learn how to fix the sewer now!😢
2024-03-13T07:28:36Z,Bro coded himself to be a future unemploy
2024-03-13T07:18:34Z,I feel sorry for person whose name is devin and he is a software engineer. He will be replaced by someone of his own name and designation.
2024-03-13T07:17:03Z,Interested in trying it out!
2024-03-13T07:10:10Z,When will Devin start Searching / posting questions on Stackoverflow 😅?
2024-03-13T06:54:39Z,Can Davin resolve my Git merge Issues?  Wanna try it and get rid of headache of resolving git merge issues.
2024-03-13T06:44:38Z,"One very fine day, almost all AI dev will realize the meaning of - Don't cut the branch on which you are sitting."
2024-03-13T06:42:33Z,So should I quit learning cs?
2024-03-13T06:39:47Z,What a wonderful software. Great high iq people build tools like this. I will definitely buy subscription for it because now as an individual i cab start business using these ai tools
2024-03-13T06:38:44Z,bye bye coders! i'd love you
2024-03-13T06:35:17Z,Reply to my comment if you want to be part of AI's research project when it gets asked about the beginning of the end of the human race
2024-03-13T06:32:36Z,"I bet as we get upset and add more prompts and Devin works off the prompts, the code is just going to turn into a ball of spaghetti"
2024-03-13T06:31:51Z,"this works well when you are writing code that is isolated against ""publicly"" available APIs, libraries and documentation e.g. spin up an example of a React application that allows me to create a to-do list.

most developers though have to work with internal resources which are poorly documented. e.g. spin up an example of a widget on the website that shows a tile of one of our product including an image and its price.


The business requirements as well are poorly communicated and developers have to sit through heaps of meetings to work out what exactly needs to be built from a problem statement."
2024-03-13T06:24:07Z,SDE's will lose it!
2024-03-13T06:18:08Z,I want to try Devin
2024-03-13T06:15:25Z,You don't even know what u are doing. It's a pandora box
2024-03-13T06:12:50Z,Thank you for taking our jobs 🤞👍
2024-03-13T06:01:30Z,Watch all the SWE transition to medicine
2024-03-13T05:52:55Z,what's up with scott's eye? My guy looks like an ai generated character.
2024-03-13T05:50:19Z,"All these computing power and intellegence and instead of helping people get rid of desiese like cancer and shit, these guys are like lets make something so large number of people on planet can get unemployed."
2024-03-13T05:48:18Z,"Not particularily impressed, look at the chat window how much guidance it needs. It's like beating your head against a junior software dev trying to get your point across repeatedly."
2024-03-13T05:47:50Z,Well it's a different world we live in now. Maybe Huang's advice of not learning how to code has a point.
2024-03-13T05:43:40Z,"Damn, my first year in this industry and was hoping to make some confident living in future. Am I doomed?"
2024-03-13T05:40:02Z,Can this guy even see? Those glasses ... get away from a screen ... jeesh
2024-03-13T05:34:14Z,"Just took a home loan a month back, seeing this feels like my job is not gonna stay for next few years, might have to commit suicide and these people smiling creating shits of mass unemployment/chaos."
2024-03-13T05:31:14Z,"Our brains work fundamentally on a different level, i doubt it can substitute people, there would be always a supervisor at least. This thing is just an average junior dev, although very dedicated, obviously. But again, every industry needs fresh people. Anyway, we are just automating stuff"
2024-03-13T05:28:58Z,"Lol. It looks like 
""hello, I'm husband. This is Devin. Ok Devin, give my wife pleasure.
Devin is equipped with his own kama sutra, viagra pill and free schedule.
Here we see Devin doing abs exercises, setting up the table and his final result, my wife sleeping with a smile on her face.
Here is Devin compared to her previous lovers.
And we are just getting started."""
2024-03-13T05:24:54Z,"I mean this is just like the world's shittiest junior engineer. You're having a longass constant conversation that we can see in the upper right hand corner that you completely gloss over and don't mention. This is already doable with ChatGPT, but the problem is it fucking sucks.

Maybe instead of trying to automate us out of a job, you could focus on actually useful things that could improve the world. Just a thought."
2024-03-13T05:22:10Z,is Scott real?
2024-03-13T05:17:37Z,Regretting life choices rn
2024-03-13T05:11:42Z,This is game changer.
2024-03-13T05:06:14Z,I'm doomed. Graduating as a programmer in the fall. All in vain.
2024-03-13T04:43:09Z,""" Whom did you leave your job to ? 
Next door Devin !! """
2024-03-13T04:42:43Z,"Ah, Just when I start making some real money"
2024-03-13T04:37:07Z,"Why isn't GitHub Copilot in the graph? You know, the one AI actually trained on code specifically? All the others are not trained to be software engineers thus won't perform nearly as well. Quite misleading..."
2024-03-13T04:31:35Z,how to using this？
2024-03-13T04:29:06Z,I need some Devin in my life. 😂
2024-03-13T04:26:26Z,Ah a nice way to speed up development and pressure these companies to more competition by building your own.
2024-03-13T04:21:44Z,"how long till Devin discovers hacking, power of botnets, will begin writing viruses and use other stuff script kiddies love to play with?
""lets see how Devin decides to attack this vulnerability"" - ""whoops we gotta roll everything back to 1980s and begin from scratch"""
2024-03-13T04:20:03Z,"Sure, devin was in the driving seat, but it looked like scott had to do a lot of backseat driving. The interaction between scott and devin feels a lot like what it's like to pair program with a junior engineer"
2024-03-13T04:05:28Z,"...a box.  Get it?  Dev in a box.  Anyway, the singularity is here."
2024-03-13T04:04:57Z,"Would your employer pay $12,000 per month for a human software engineer who only works 40 hours per week or pay $12 per month for an AI agent that works 24x7? 🤔"
2024-03-13T03:42:57Z,Leaving this comment at 2.28k subs on  8:42pm pst date is 3/12/2024. The day I realized my career was in fact over..
2024-03-13T03:38:32Z,you made an AI that does print debugging instead of using an actual debugger? Sounds more like the world's first AI junior developer.
2024-03-13T03:35:24Z,"Did we see his role mentioned as human software engineer at start!!
And at the end him mentioning its just the start! Doomed!🤖"
2024-03-13T03:31:07Z,Where is the request?
2024-03-13T03:30:55Z,Wow Eating jobs of lakhs of people for a certain amount of short-term profit 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂👍👍
2024-03-13T03:23:54Z,"Where can I test this out? Please send me a link, I'd like to try it out with Unity"
2024-03-13T03:21:30Z,"Hey Scott, i applied for access earlier, ow is my application progressing"
2024-03-13T03:08:05Z,Hi I would like to try Devin
2024-03-13T03:03:16Z,Fk.. I still have a 15-year term loan to pay..
2024-03-13T02:54:30Z,"lmao why focus on the AI adding print statements. If 'Devin' was already smart enough to read through the code and documentation, it wouldn't make sense to print the outputs. Even free chat-gpt can simulate input to outputs already.

So far this demo is targetted more towards Investors than Engineers. Good job hyping up investors. Just prepare your answer when they ask why Devin can't build what the Product Manager is asking for properly, why it can't scale, why it implemented the business rules wrong."
2024-03-13T02:44:40Z,Why are you guys are so hell bent on replacing creative jobs ? I don't  understand.  Government  should ban and jail you guys .
2024-03-13T02:39:07Z,"if I had access to a software engineer, I'd want to create a system that functions in the same way as a librarian, but for all human knowledge. Go through wikipedia, check every source, then have it read every source and see what its sources are, and determine if the foundational sources were even talking about the same things, or if it's a source loop leading back to wikipedia for newer books, and so on. Then after presenting all the faulty sources to the moderators, we'd have a much more reliable way to test if sources are legitimate or if someone's not doing their research."
2024-03-13T02:29:50Z,How can I try it out?
2024-03-13T02:28:46Z,Your telling me codellama-13b and 7b was finetuned to be better than gpt-4 at coding. This is clearly false advertising.
2024-03-13T02:17:14Z,Paying Devin for the same work I can do using genertive AI? No thanks.  Beside what it did was a fucking html frontend page with css that's crap. Ask it to build a full stack large scale project like Netflix full featured then we talk.
2024-03-13T02:09:27Z,Is it still worthy to learn web development now?
2024-03-13T01:52:30Z,Devin… just wanna say you look good today. I’ve always been a fan of robots and Siri.  lol
2024-03-13T01:50:26Z,Learn to code they said... They are going to have to tax the hell out of these AI assistants so those of us who are watching our careers utterly implode don't lose everything we have. Society won't stand once that starts to happen to enough people.
2024-03-13T01:48:07Z,"Devin == Demon

pls stop projects like this, i don't want to lose my future job..."
2024-03-13T01:43:43Z,But... can it solve the Captcha on browsers though?
2024-03-13T01:31:59Z,Requesting access to use Devin. Need it to rebuild my AI stock reporter
2024-03-13T01:31:56Z,Oh the irony. It hurts
2024-03-13T01:26:48Z,"Remember kids, A.I currently have no desire to build anything humans do."
2024-03-13T01:21:01Z,I'm interested in testing
2024-03-13T01:20:01Z,stop him before its too late :D
2024-03-13T01:09:10Z,This dude is smiling about forwarding the goals of the most vile evil
2024-03-13T01:04:56Z,"Nice! It's pretty cool to see an AI debug code the same way humans do. I see there's a bit of guidance from the human in the chat still, but it looks like maybe not much more than paired programming and the occasional nudge? Looking forward to seeing how this changes the world 😁"
2024-03-13T01:04:24Z,I would like to try it
2024-03-13T00:42:01Z,This is the reason why programmers went to the deep web and offered illegal jobs lol
2024-03-13T00:41:28Z,I would love to test Devin on a true engineering problem that could have HUGE medical advance implications.   Please contact me for access to it
2024-03-13T00:24:30Z,"From now on, Devin is in the driver's seat...😮"
2024-03-13T00:16:34Z,"Devin, please build me a house"
2024-03-13T00:15:36Z,Can’t wait till the Singularity drops
2024-03-13T00:13:50Z,Somebody needs to cut Scott Wu's break lines.
2024-03-13T00:06:51Z,"Well, if you're going to put everyone else out of a job I suppose it's only fair you do it yourselves too. lol"
2024-03-13T00:05:02Z,WHO IS HERE FROM TURKEY LET'S GO!!!!!! 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
2024-03-13T00:03:18Z,"ok, nice video, but let us test it first. Then I will decide if it can be an assistant to our software development engineers."
2024-03-12T23:57:39Z,Mindblowing stuff
2024-03-12T23:57:10Z,"""Devin is a tireless"". This is some scary stuff, why would anyone want to hire human engineers when this machine can spit code 24/7."
2024-03-12T23:51:26Z,"""Here's Devin zoning out during daily standup"""
2024-03-12T23:48:00Z,"There is a company that is advertising to learn C++ and Python. Do you think it is worth to spend thousand of dollars on this six to 2 year course? So around 2026, I can graduate and apply to companies saying I am a basic programmer? Do you think someone will hire me?"
2024-03-12T23:32:01Z,guys seems cracked
2024-03-12T23:31:32Z,Ask Devin to build Devin! Devins all the way down!
2024-03-12T23:26:09Z,I just started coding 2 days ago 😢
2024-03-12T23:26:09Z,The only permanent thing in the universe is change. Generative artificial intelligence and lm: path of no return.
2024-03-12T23:17:13Z,"I've been making the same thing, utilizing crewai. This is fucking awesome."
2024-03-12T23:13:34Z,Whose job will be replaced next? Is Scott on the chopping block?
2024-03-12T23:04:18Z,Can I try it out?
2024-03-12T22:34:11Z,I want more 😊
2024-03-12T22:22:45Z,"Making game is my dream, can devin do it for me 😂🎉
Would like to try 😊"
2024-03-12T22:21:39Z,When will it be released?
2024-03-12T21:56:16Z,Yo
2024-03-12T21:52:19Z,I need this in my life. Jumping in the waitlist
2024-03-12T21:52:09Z,the creators of this are the students that reminded the teacher that we had homework lol
2024-03-12T21:51:26Z,"wow, this is awesome!"
2024-03-12T21:51:07Z,Please can I request access to Devin? TIA!
2024-03-12T21:49:27Z,"And here am I, about to start a CS degree 😂😮😢"
2024-03-12T21:48:46Z,Would love to try it out myself.
2024-03-12T21:32:49Z,literal worst name for an AI so far
2024-03-12T21:29:31Z,So many CS graduates getting frosty watching this
2024-03-12T21:23:57Z,"Devin hired Scott to demonstrate its abilities. ""Hello Devin""."
2024-03-12T21:23:45Z,Great. Where could I try Devin?
2024-03-12T21:20:01Z,Kinda looks like Scott is giving continuous commands.
2024-03-12T21:19:42Z,Waiting till this news is picked up by everyone else.
2024-03-12T21:13:31Z,I'm stopping denying reality and I'm starting to accept it. It's over.
2024-03-12T21:12:08Z,"need to find a new skill, i guess Devin can have my job now 😢
Wonder if Devin changed to real Devil 😂"
2024-03-12T21:06:43Z,Devin is cool but he is not the first one for sure. Just another AI coding tool 👍🏻
2024-03-12T20:53:20Z,Imagine losing your job because of an AI named fucking Devin
2024-03-12T20:49:31Z,"I think I don't need education loan anymore, I need venture capital"
2024-03-12T20:40:55Z,well there goes our job…anyone wanna start a street food stall with me?
2024-03-12T20:39:30Z,this is a big dub fr
2024-03-12T20:38:14Z,"well, I'm going back to be a hairdresser"
2024-03-12T20:35:03Z,I need AI to help with office politics.
2024-03-12T20:34:55Z,"Well, that's it, we're homeless now guys 😭😭😭"
2024-03-12T20:22:49Z,Open source or gtfo
2024-03-12T20:18:53Z,"You're super excited that millions of programers will loose their jobs? Great! 😃

I'm kidding, nothing wrong with that. Many machine writers lost their jobs too in 60/70. And the world moved on."
2024-03-12T20:13:32Z,"Not a programmer nor remotely involved in the field, but what happens when this takes off and gets wide spread?  That's gonna be a ton of jobs lost in that field, not the mention the other ones that are being phased out presently by automation lol."
2024-03-12T20:07:51Z,Oh I can’t wait to try it! 👏
2024-03-12T19:59:19Z,"as a software engineer, are we finished..."
2024-03-12T19:54:20Z,"I was here, witnessed it, but could do nothing to stop the beginning of the end."
2024-03-12T19:48:50Z,"its over guys
and btw here at 515 subs
it sure will get a million before april"
2024-03-12T19:44:02Z,I would like to try Devin! Please!
2024-03-12T19:36:52Z,Amazing. Great job guys.
2024-03-12T19:35:38Z,"Literally, devin fuck off, i just want to keep on coding and make a decent living and not have to worry about cocksucking robots replacing me"
2024-03-12T19:31:28Z,Bro sitting on the couch engineered his own layoff as well as ours
2024-03-12T19:24:51Z,How can we try out Devin with our .NET developer teams?
2024-03-12T19:18:03Z,"Magic has a wait list, too. I would like to see a public repo with issues worked and reviewed by both Magic and Devin, since I don't have access to either one."
2024-03-12T19:16:55Z,Requesting access!
2024-03-12T19:15:38Z,I would like to try devin!
2024-03-12T19:15:08Z,Can Devin fix a sink?
2024-03-12T19:02:54Z,I think I might have to start farming  😂
2024-03-12T19:02:12Z,Would love to try this out for some on-chain web application work with very new libraries!
2024-03-12T18:46:25Z,An AI software engineer made with software to help you with software.
2024-03-12T18:36:59Z,I would like to try devin!
2024-03-12T18:36:27Z,"It’s joever guys, we need universal basic income for what’s to come"
2024-03-12T18:29:02Z,"1st year fresher in cs, wtf do I do now? 💀💀"
2024-03-12T18:28:27Z,"Destroying tech jobs with a smile. Great job, you will make a lot of people lost their jobs"
2024-03-12T18:27:20Z,Request. Please reach out.
2024-03-12T18:25:19Z,Devin probably created Scott as its CEO avatar to show its invention!
2024-03-12T18:24:29Z,I'm really excited to try it and see how it works.
2024-03-12T18:24:15Z,"This is awesome, well done!"
2024-03-12T18:16:46Z,Devin is mogging all the human software engineers
2024-03-12T18:05:27Z,Sir please grant acess🙌🏻
2024-03-12T18:04:53Z,"Really cool , engineers are now going to write better captcha for limiting access to documentation by ai 😂😂"
2024-03-12T18:04:20Z,"Were early, channel literally has 200 subscribers 😅 it will probably be a in 6 digits in a month"
2024-03-12T18:02:42Z,"If they could release this kind of product, then openai already has agi boys"
2024-03-12T18:01:35Z,Devin's ability to solve errors and looking up documentation to solve tasks makes it far better than co-pilot  or any another product
2024-03-12T18:00:38Z,"Plot twist, Scott is AI generated as well as this video to showcase the work of his colleague named Devin."
2024-03-12T17:57:36Z,"Scott wu , wu brothers are going to invent the real life matrix."
2024-03-12T17:56:23Z,This is going to be crazy

2024-03-12T17:51:41Z,"wow thays really amazing cool
please pinned i want to share to my friends it"
2024-03-12T17:49:04Z,"Software engineer seeing this video ""What the.."
2024-03-12T17:42:10Z,"This is amazing to see and once the first has emerged, many others will follow.  I'm interested to hear what the Cognition moat is here - how do you stay ahead of the chasing pack having taken first mover?  A good video though - clear and simple to follow.  Congrats!"
2024-03-12T17:41:27Z,It's closer than we think
2024-03-12T17:40:52Z,I would like to try it out
2024-03-12T17:28:10Z,Can’t wait for Devin to handle my slack messages and pull requests.
2024-03-12T17:27:47Z,"Ahh fuck, was hoping it would take a couple of more years"
2024-03-12T17:06:04Z,It’ll be interesting to see if this model is trained on any copyrighted material
2024-03-12T17:01:16Z,Its over for us now 😔

2024-03-12T16:54:19Z,"next 10 years the software engineering career will be over, just a fact"
2024-03-12T16:48:51Z,So did I just got unemployed before I could graduate and get first job :(
2024-03-12T16:45:24Z,career in tech are destined to be over then?
2024-03-12T16:37:05Z,I'm so relieved seeing AI still uses print statements to debug their code 😂 0:50
2024-03-12T16:30:13Z,"Request: I'm a human software engineer too, and I'd love to try it out on some real world tasks"
