Mechanical engineering (till the arrival of robots, which are very expensive to build)<br>6. Electrical engineering (dealing with electrical systems, which even robots may struggle with)<br>7.

Recent news have came that devin was programmed to do a specific problem. And also we dont know anything that is going on in this video. Maybe it was programmed to do a specific task. News have came that a task that takes aost a day for devin is done in 3 to 6 hours by a human. So focus on becoming a great skilled software engii and dont let this skinny japanesse guy named scott scare you. I think this devin and the creators just wanted some fundings. These guys are fake.,1

2024-04-13T22:17:52Z,@NeoS-zw2ps,"Devin is sold as being able to solve arbitrary Upwork tasks. In the video demo the problem it was asked to solve doesn&#39;t match the stated requirements of the customer (who asked for setup instructions, not code).<br><br>• Devin is shown fixing errors in the source of a GitHub repo, but the files it&#39;s shown editing don&#39;t actually exist in that repo and some of the errors its fixing are nonsensical, of the type that&#39;d never be made by a human. Inference: Devin must be fixing bugs in files it has itself created, but that&#39;s not clearly indicated.<br><br>• There is no need to do any coding in the first place, because the README in the repository has all the instructions needed to achieve the task ready to go and they still work fine with only a one-line tweak, even though the repository is old. This is why the customer asked for instructions for how to run it on EC2 rather than for some coding. Devin didn&#39;t seem to read the README or understand that it only had to execute a couple of pre-existing Python scripts. The output in the video makes it look like the task was complex and sophisticated, with a long plan and many check boxes showing work completed, but the work was in fact pointless and redundant.<br><br>• Devin&#39;s code changes are bad, e.g. writing its own low level file read loop instead of using the standard library properly.<br><br>• Although the video makes it look like Devin did the task quickly, and the video creator was able to do the requested task in ~30 minutes, the timestamps in the chat show the task stretching over many hours and even into the next day.<br><br>• Devin does nonsensical shell commands like `head -n 5 foo | tail -n 5`",7

2024-04-13T20:19:38Z,@IONYVDFC,"Software development and the way it translates to machine code has always been &quot;layered&quot; and always will be; this is a new level in programming.  Programming languages, and what we call libraries and frameworks, were already a sign that the layer at which we code today is already too low for the complexity of the requirements we are facing.   I was coding assembler in the 80s.  Gosh, have I seen so many layers building up since?   I would be called an old nagger by nowadays developers if I complained that my machine code skills couldn&#39;t make my bread and butter anymore.   The only scary part I would say is the speed at which this new &#39;paradigm&#39; unfolds.  Our biological brains surely won&#39;t get faster used to the idea of re-skilling ourselves into efficient manipulators to become successful at what we today call programming.

2024-03-25T12:12:51Z,@dipeshgurung3364,"People who aren&#39;t software engineers and are currently learning about technology might feel anxious or insecure about the potential impact of AI tools like &quot;Devin.&quot;🤣🤣 However, from a developer&#39;s perspective, these tools are simply additional aids that can assist in the development process. Even looking ahead a decade or more, companies will continue to rely on human developers. It&#39;s highly unlikely that a CEO would personally use a tool like &quot;Devin&quot; and suddenly claim they can handle all development tasks. The reality is that there&#39;s a significant number of real-world problems requiring immediate solutions, and this is where skilled engineers play an indispensable role.<br><br>AI POV: Indeed, while AI can automate certain tasks and make certain processes more efficient, there are still many aspects of software development that require human expertise, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. CEOs and decision-makers in companies understand the value of skilled developers and the critical role they play in building and maintaining technology systems.<br><br>It&#39;s unlikely to completely eliminate the need for skilled professionals in the foreseeable future.",1

2024-03-20T12:17:29Z,@ricardo5460,"What happens if Devin misunderstands one of the instructions or feeds off from wrong data somewhere along the line? The developer would need to try to reverse engineer the entire process and find out first what Devin was trying to do, what the mistake was, how it can be solved, and then try to integrate that into Devin&#39;s solution. This is the issue not only with Devin but also with AI in general, including ChatGPT. There is a running joke about &quot;coding&quot; in 2 minutes with AI and debugging for hours, and that it is true. These tools are useful, at the moment, only for simple pieces of code, like creating a boilerplate for a React component, a basic database, generating mock data, etc., but no real programmer would use them to build something that requires deep critical thinking and metacognition. Am I saying that these tools will not get better? No. But let&#39;s consider that evolution happens in both ways (humans and robots). Two years ago, junior developers would proudly build a simple calculator or a one-page HTML and JavaScript page and make it the focus of their portfolio. Today, with the current tools, a junior developer can easily apply knowledge of APIs, databases, frameworks, etc., to build a CRUD application in a matter of weeks/days. As these machines get smarter, human beings are also getting more competent at building more complex projects and liberating their time to think and truly innovate, building products that are useful and impactful. We have a very exciting future ahead of us.",2

People behind the technology know this, but they will be doing whatever they need to prop their stock prices and grab as much money as they can.<br><br>If you think I&#39;m wrong and technology will improve, well, think deeply and learn how LLMs work. These are pure machine learning algorithms involving multiplication of large matrices. It will produce errors by design no matter how large the model is and one error is enough to destroy a life, a company... you name it.<br><br>The LLMs and similar ML models will be good in generating some high demand pictures and video in adult industry, spamming internet and faking facts, so most people will not know what to believe.

And bigger tech enterprises won&#39;t use these AI&#39;s since they can&#39;t trust them with there code so yeah it will be bad for the average developers.

Go through wikipedia, check every source, then have it read every source and see what its sources are, and determine if the foundational sources were even talking about the same things, or if it&#39;s a source loop leading back to wikipedia for newer books, and so on. Then after presenting all the faulty sources to the moderators, we&#39;d have a much more reliable way to test if sources are legitimate or if someone&#39;s not doing their research.",0
